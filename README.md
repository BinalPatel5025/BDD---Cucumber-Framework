# BDD-Cucumber-Framework
Cucumber is a testing framework which supports Behavior Driven Development (BDD) approch. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a collaborative approach to software development that focuses on defining the expected behavior of a system from the perspective of its users. BDD uses a common language, often based on the Gherkin syntax, to write features and scenarios that describe how the system should work in different situations. These features and scenarios can then be used as the basis for testing, documentation, and communication among the development team and the stakeholders.
